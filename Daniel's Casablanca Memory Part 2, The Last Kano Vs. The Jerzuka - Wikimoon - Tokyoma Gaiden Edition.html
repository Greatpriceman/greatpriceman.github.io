<p>Daniel walks down the street with an umbrella, and runs into Rose outside of a flower shop. Rose explains that the rain has been hard on the barrier islands all day, and she went inland to get her own umbrella. She looks over at people passing by and says that everyone seems to be so gloomy, and adds that she's been hearing that the Jerzuka may be returning. Daniel agrees, and suggests that the two of them go somewhere to talk.
</p><p>The two teens enter the Times Go By restaurant, and Daniel is greeted by the waiter as Rose looks uncomfortable. After they're seated, Daniel mentions that Rose said something about her cousin being killed in the past. Rose replies that she and she and her entire family were killed on thanksgiving, three years ago, but has recently found out someone else also survived the massacre. Daniel replies that they're kindred spirits, but Rose only looks confused.
</p><p>Daniel remembers the Thanksgiving Massacre as though it took place yesterday, but shortly afterwards seeing his entire family lying dead on the ground. Feeling distraught, he ran away, and wasn't able to be found by authorities for a few days. He called Senator Andrews, who told him that Daniel's father was going to succeed him someday; his family was killed by the Jerzuka for political reasons, since the Kanos were strictly Anti-Mafia. Rose says that she believed her cousin had been killed attempting to escape from a the Jerzuka Mafia.
</p><p>He awakes from his reverie and goes over to the grand piano, asking the Piano player to play the theme of the movie Casablanca. After she finishes, another woman sits down to play, and Daniel seems to sense something odd about her. He doesn't stop to think about it, though, as he suddenly feels like there's something wrong with him that's making him feel so oddly sentimental. Daniel returns to Rose, who has fallen asleep, and the two of them leave. Feeling much relieved once in the fresh air, Daniel wonders why the air was so oppressive inside.
</p><p>Daniel walks through the rain with Rose. As they pass a display of music boxes, he thinks that the almost constant melody is annoying. When he arrives at Rose's apartment there is no answer, but the door is unlocked so they enter. Once inside, Rose Looks at Daniel, saying he looks like her cousin, if he had lived. Realizing something is wrong, both teens pick up the music box and hurl it to the ground, shattering it, which makes the two finally realize who the other person is. However, a wireless microphone is poking out from within the broken music box. Daniel realizes that an enemy was eavesdropping on them with the possessed music boxes.
</p><p>Daniel remembers a time when The runaway Daniel stowed away on a plane bound for Tokyo, Japan and Senator Andrews was on the same flight, Intending to talk to his counterpart, a politician known as <a href="http://localhost/index.php/Ryuuji_Hino" title="Ryuuji Hino">Hino</a>. Intending on asking him to adopt the now orphaned Daniel without realizing that he is on the very same plane. Daniel grew annoyed and stumbled into the first class seating,  asking why he is sending him away from New Jersey, then demands to know if he was clearing the evidence, causing a scene. Andrews replies by paying for Daniel's ticket, and tells him that he intended to talk to him about it after the plane trip, but says it's too late now, though he says that Daniel will have the final say on whether he gets adopted. He remembers Politician Hino talking about how <a href="http://localhost/index.php/Rei_Hino" title="Rei Hino">his daughter</a> should have married someone as politically powerful as he is, and arranges for him to be adopted by her instead. both Daniel and Rei outright reject the adoption, but Daniel decided to stay at the <a href="http://localhost/index.php/Hikawa_Shrine" title="Hikawa Shrine">Hikawa Shrine</a> for another reason, then added that something else is trying to call him there, he doesn't know what though. while Politician Hino is outraged by the decision, Senator Andrews respects it.
</p><p>In the present, Daniel cries out and the onlookers turn to look at Daniel and Rose. The woman who was playing the piano at the restaurant appears, along with a portion of the Jerzuka Mafia. The woman declares that she has found the last two Kanos remaining, and she intends to have the two reduced to empty shells.
</p><p>Old memories flood into Daniel Kano, and he remembers his Family, and his cousin, and then Rose's face appears, seeing a near identical match. Daniel Kano angrily declares that he will not dwell on the past, and calls upon Patrice, an Eagle to aid him. He uses <a href="http://localhost/index.php?title=Firebird_Striker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Firebird Striker (page does not exist)">Firebird Striker</a> and blasts the woman, who is revealed to be Signora Jerzuka in disguise; he was trying to eliminate the last of the Kanos to secure his dominance on southern New Jersey.
</p><p>Daniel has the waiter from before spirit Rose away. Senator Andrews tries to persuade Daniel to take her to Japan for her safety.
</p><p>When the police arrest Daniel on a trumped-up murder charge, Senator Andrews persuades the police to release him by promising to set the real criminals up for a much more serious crime: Genocide. To allay the Police's suspicions, Senator Andrews explains that Daniel and Rose <i>Hino</i> will be leaving for Japan. Daniel tries to escape from the Mafia, with the police, when the Jerzuka Mafia begin shooting at them. while the Jerzuka are chasing Daniel, Senator Andrews makes Rose board the plane to Tokyo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed without seeing her cousin again, "Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life." Signora, tipped off by the Police, drives up alone. The Air Force shoots him when he draws his pistol and tries to intervene. Back on the parkway Daniel soon dodges the gunfire and even reflects some of it back at the Jerzukas, destroying their cars and causing a 20-car pile up, When policemen arrive, the Chief pauses, then orders them to "round up the survivors". He suggests to Daniel that he joins the force in Brigantine. Daniel declines the offer and asks them to drive him to the airport, Daniel says, "I don't think I have to worry about them anymore."
</p><p>Daniel arrives at the airport and boards the plane, joining Rose as it heads towards Tokyo
</p><p>That Christmas, Daniel is opening presents in the sun. Narun squints up at the bright sun and declares that whatever plagued Daniel now seems like just a bad dream. Pinako calls over to invite Daniel to come skating, but Daniel declines, insisting he's fine where he is. A new shrine maiden arrives to bring him another present, and Daniel smiles and says that's his fifth one from her; the maiden is perfectly happy to see her cousin again after so long. His friends look on, expressions varying between hopeful and confused, Daniel then introduces his friends to his cousin, Rose.
</p><p>at the same time, in a prison in New Jersey, a breakout has occurred, as someone has snuck onto the street with alarms blaring, the person goes "I'll get you Kano, if it's the last thing I do!"
